A "portfolio" website would be a personal website that showcases my academic and professional background, including my education, internships, and any relevant coursework or projects. Additionally, it  feature a list of skills and technologies I are proficient in, such as React, Next, Sanity, and JavaScript. The website is  designed to be a one-stop-shop for potential employers or clients to learn more about my qualifications and experience.
